**Context** (optional)


The main aim of this milestone was to iron out the basic functionalities of the application and team playing feature. Detailed deliverables are listed in the application as well as in the next section here.
Latest version of the application is **deployed live** on [khoj-app.vercel.app](https://khoj-app.vercel.app/). We have created a test hunt for anyone to test with the location proximity settings set to very high for easy testing. Please feel free to try the hunt out 😉

| 1.  | Replace Coinbase CDP with Reown Kit	 | [9467a663ebe3f8d55095d0c2764abde3f83ee46a](https://github.com/ayush4345/Khoj/commit/9467a663ebe3f8d55095d0c2764abde3f83ee46a) | After careful consideration, ease of integration and compatibility with PassetHub, we decided to use the [ThirdWeb Wallet](https://thirdweb.com/wallets) instead. We created a custom chain configuration for PassetHub and now support seamless Web2 native onboarding. | 
| 2.  | Replace Walrus with IPFS/Crust		 |[30c8b913361346c80cb4aa156038ed6c53951679](https://github.com/ayush4345/Khoj/commit/30c8b913361346c80cb4aa156038ed6c53951679)| We moved to a simpler way of storage by using Pinata. All the requied hunt and clues metadata is now stored on IPFS. This also involved ironing out lots of minor bugs, data processing format issues. Pinata related functions used in [`pinata.js`](https://github.com/ayush4345/Khoj/commit/74fc665ba539528f1b1ec9c4bf6a5108c6522765#diff-6fd1b19c920aa3e0ee2a1ee39ea228762bd323335c022d6e34c5a7e9f0026f62) | 
| 3.  | Perplexity Sonar API	 | [2ae4358fd9cc23d65c1d8616ec650f6f29e82d0b](https://github.com/ayush4345/Khoj/commit/2ae4358fd9cc23d65c1d8616ec650f6f29e82d0b) | We revised this deliverable to instead use Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite model. This is mainly due to the avaialbility of strucuted responses. Since we require the clues from the LLM in JSON format, it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain consistency in the output generated by the LLM, breaking the clue generation process. Another reason is the cost-effective pricing of Gemini. With structured responses and a retrying mechanism, we are seeing much higher levels of consistency. We also added a theme field in the hunt creation page to help guide the LLM to generate thematic clues. | 
| 4.  | Improvements to location verification		 |[2b79c5e798649c62c8cad194958f6b00bb5d483a](https://github.com/ayush4345/Khoj/commit/2b79c5e798649c62c8cad194958f6b00bb5d483a)| Used the Haversine Distance formula to accurately calculate proximity with 1-10m accuracy. We also realised that mobile phones use the built-in GPS sensor even when accessed by web browsers, resulting in very high accuracy in the coordinates received. Since our PWA is targeted at mobile users, this works great. | 
| 5.  | Team based gameplays			 |...| This involed a major and rather underestimated effort. We desgined a new flow to support team creation and joining existing teams via an invite code, while keeping security and ease of use in mind. Hunts can now be played in teams while the hunt owner having the ability to switch off team support while designing the hunt. |
