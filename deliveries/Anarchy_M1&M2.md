# Milestone Delivery 2📬

**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/delivery/blob/master/delivery-guidelines.md).**

**Context**
Built in AI text-image generator
Integrating the Pollinations API (adding to the Creative Commons licensing we are currently building in to the tech stack) will allow the user to do the following actions on the Anarchy site:
i) learn about AI (through our education modules hosted in association with The Blockchain Academy)
ii) create in-app designs with Pollinations (later we will look to expand this to low-code builders or have direct APIs where users can directly upload their work to the platform and begin to earn from staking
iii) monetise their uploads via buy/sell features and creator staking
The deliverable here is an integrated front-end that allows for text-image generation and then one-click minting in-app.
