**Context**
This milestone delivers the complete integration of [**NFT Mozaic API**](https://wiki.nftmozaic.com/docs/category/developers/) enabling full NFT marketplace functionality on the Polkadot ecosystem. The implementation fulfills the Polkadot NFTMozaic Consensus Hong Kong 2025 Challenge requirements and includes:

- **Multi-Network Support**: Integrated 6 Polkadot ecosystem networks (Kusama AssetHub, Polkadot AssetHub, Unique Network, Westend, Rococo, Opal) with proper token handling and network-aware operations
- **Real Blockchain Integration**: Replaced mock data with actual blockchain queries using Unique SDK for authentic NFT trading, ownership validation, and trade history
- **IPFS Storage**: Complete Pinata IPFS integration for decentralized storage of NFT images and metadata with JWT authentication and API key fallback
- **Advanced Caching System**: Implemented intelligent caching with configurable TTL for collections (2 min), IPFS metadata (1 hour), and network stats (30 sec) to optimize performance
- **Professional Rebranding**: Complete transformation from NexusArt to MozaicDot with comprehensive SEO optimization, favicon integration, and PWA-ready configuration
- **Enhanced UX**: Responsive network selector, real-time trade history, proper error handling, and mobile-optimized interface

The platform now supports the full NFT lifecycle from creation to trading with real blockchain interactions across multiple Polkadot networks.
