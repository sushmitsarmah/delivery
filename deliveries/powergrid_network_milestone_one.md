## Context

PowerGrid Network Milestone 1 delivers the core smart-contract infrastructure for our decentralized virtual power plant on Polkadot. We now have fully functional ink! 5.1 contracts for device onboarding, grid-event coordination, tokenized rewards, and on-chain governance—providing a production-ready foundation for coordinating thousands of home energy devices and rewarding grid services through the $PWGD economy.

This stack lets homeowners register their devices, participate in demand-response events, earn rewards, and steer network governance—all secured by Polkadot’s contracts parachain.

## Technical Achievements

- **4 production-ready ink! contracts** with cross-contract wiring and payable constructors for deployment endowments  
- **24 automated tests** in CI-ready scripts (`build-all`, `test-all`, `test-integration`)  
- **Real ink! E2E coverage**—contracts deployed to a local Substrate node via `ink_e2e`, proving actual cross-contract execution  
- **Complete user journey validation** from device registration → grid event → reward minting → governance update  
- **Optimized Wasm artifacts** (≈12–18 KB) with ink! toolchain 5.1.1 and `cargo-contract` 5.0.1  
- **New developer experience**: Docker-based environment, `/tmp` target dir guidance for limited storage, transparent logging in tests  
- **Robust error handling and type-safe design**—all public APIs return descriptive errors matching business logic  

---

## Contract Specifications

1. **Resource Registry** (≈17 KB Wasm)  
   - Device onboarding with stake validation and metadata  
   - Reputation tracking & authorized caller management  
   - 5 unit tests covering happy paths, insufficient stake, caller permissions

2. **Grid Service** (≈16 KB Wasm)  
   - Grid-event lifecycle, participation, verification, and reward triggers  
   - Reputation-weighted rewards with bonus multipliers  
   - 6 unit tests addressing creation, participation, verification, automation logic

3. **PowerGrid Token ($PWGD)** (≈18 KB Wasm)  
   - PSP22-compliant rewards token with mint/burn roles  
   - Admin pause & allowance checks  
   - 5 unit tests validating mint, burn, transfers, approvals, role gating

4. **Governance** (≈12 KB Wasm)  
   - Proposal create/vote/queue/execute with quorum and timelock  
   - Registry/grid parameter updates via a typed proposal enum  
   - E2E tests ensure voting → queue → execute works with real block/timestamp progress

---

## Integration & E2E Validation

We provide **eight** integration tests under `contracts/integration-tests`:

### Real ink! E2E Tests (`--features e2e-tests`)
1. `test_real_contract_deployments` – Deploys all contracts to a live node with endowments  
2. `test_cross_contract_deployment_dependencies` – Validates dependency ordering (Token → Registry → Grid)  
3. `test_device_registration_and_rewards` – Full rewards flow from registration through minting  
4. `test_governance_updates_registry` – Proposal vote/queue/execute updating Registry parameters

### Simulation Tests (no feature flag)
5. `test_complete_user_journey` – 5-step logical journey (device → event → reward → governance)  
6. `test_data_flow_integration` – Cross-contract data propagation  
7. `test_error_handling_integration` – Failure paths and validation  
8. `test_scalability_integration` – Multi-user/multi-event scenarios

Run them all with logging:

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/cargo-target cargo test -p integration-tests --features e2e-tests -- --nocapture
```

## Additional Information

- **Development status**: Milestone 1 is production-ready; contracts and tests are stable on `main`.  
- **Community feedback**: Addressed requests for “no placeholders” by delivering real E2E deployment tests with actual Wasm execution.  
- **Next steps**: Milestone 2 targets device firmware integrations and live telemetry ingestion.  
- **Repository status**: `main` branch contains the final milestone code, including Docker support.  
- **Build system**: Automated scripts (`setup.sh`, `run-node.sh`, `build-all.sh`, `test-all.sh`, `test-integration.sh`) ease onboarding.  
- **Docker**: A streamlined dev image (`powergrid-dev`) with Rust, ink! tooling, and `substrate-contracts-node` installed.  
- **Testing summary**: 16 unit tests + 8 integration/E2E tests = 24 total, all passing.

## 🔬 How to Test Milestone 1

### 1. Prepare environment (Ubuntu/macOS)
Follow [`docs/setup-and-testing.md`](https://github.com/kunal-drall/powergrid_network/blob/main/docs/setup-and-testing.md) or run:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### 2. Start local node
```bash
./scripts/run-node.sh
```
(leave it running in a separate terminal for E2E tests)

### 3. Build all contracts
```bash
./scripts/build-all.sh
```

### 4. Run workspace tests (unit + docs)
```bash
./scripts/test-all.sh
```

### 5. Run E2E integration suite
```bash
./scripts/test-integration.sh
```

Expected outcomes:
- Optimized Wasm artifacts in `target/ink/<contract>/`
- All 16 unit tests and 8 integration/E2E tests passing with detailed logs
- Governance proposal E2E demonstrates vote → queue → execute on a live node
